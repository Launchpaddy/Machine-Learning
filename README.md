# Machine-Learning
Machine Learning and Data Mining in Python and R  
This class was focused on covering as many algorithems as possible.   
Deep learnig, k-means,Naive bayes,Neural network,Random forest, apriori, clustering, and are only a few that we covered.  
For each project we would clean the data from a dataset and test our algorithems accuracy.
